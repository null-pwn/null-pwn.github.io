I’m ‘NULL’_P∆N a Romanian security researcher and security enthusiast.

I usually keep my advises and research for myself without any available public but I’ve decided to put here anything I found.

This blog will always be about security.

This blog may contain in future content about related Romanian vulnerabilities, breaches, prevention, and possibly many more.

I have no interest to make this personal. I need a place to put everything online and here I am.
