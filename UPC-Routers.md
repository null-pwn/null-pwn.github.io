I’ve recently tested a UPC old router, to be specific a Ubee EVW3226 cable modem. 
This specific model is using WPS, an outdated security protocol for authentication 
and sadly can be easily bypassed by any script kiddie using tools as Wifite or a simple 
Android app. Not only is vulnerabile to this attack but also can be DOS-ed abusing port 80. 
Nmap shows that is vulnerabile to Slowloris or CVE-2007-6750 but I didn’t test yet. 
But I didn’t finish yet, routers use pathetic login credentials like admin/admin making 
for an attackers a piece of cake to change your “password” and SSID or changing DNS server 
and stealing your online banking account. If your router is vulnerabile to the same type of 
attack change your WiFi password and router login page password immediately!
